This project is to moniter how long and how often I use my Fedora install.
 
It has a systemd service file, this will run uptime and gather system info.
Also planning a Python script to generate the HTML graphs.

How it works:

1. uptimer.service runs starttime.sh, this outputs an Epoch to uptimer-start.log (hardcoded, watch out)
2. run `stoptimer.sh uptimer-seconds.log` to output the difference between the Epoch values and date
3. run `uptimer.py uptimer-seconds.log` to generate time.html

Need to have useful erroring, log cleanup. On the way.
