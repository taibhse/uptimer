This project is to moniter how long and how often I use my Fedora install.
Its just for fun and is still a work in progress.


It has a systemd service file, this will run uptime and gather system info.
We will also have a Python script to generate the HTML graphs.

I'll fill this out more once I complete more of the work, there isn't too much here yet.
